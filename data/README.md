# Funscript Data Directory

Place funscript files here in this directory.

Use the PlatformIO tools to "Upload Filesystem Image" to the device.

Files will be played in alphabetical order.

Notes:
- Ensure the filenames have a ".funscript" file extension, or else they will not be read.
- Keep the filenames short, under 32 chars in length.
- Keep total size within the device's max onboard flash limit (about 1.5 MB, compressed).
- Limit to 10 files max.
